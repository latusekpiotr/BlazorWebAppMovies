## Package Management

### NuGet Package Behavior
The NuGet packages referenced in the project file (`.csproj`) aren't necessarily the latest patch package releases. However, patch releases in .NET roll-forward automatically when the app is built and packages are restored. There's no need to update the package versions in the project file to the latest patch releases.

### Key Dependencies
- **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory**: In-memory database provider
- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.QuickGrid**: Advanced data grid functionality
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Http**: HTTP client factory for API integrations

## Cleanup

When you're finished with the application, you can simply delete the application folder. Since the app uses an InMemory database, no database cleanup is required. All data is automatically cleared when the application stops.
