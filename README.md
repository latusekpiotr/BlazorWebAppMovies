## Requirements

- .NET 8.0 or later
- Any modern web browser
- No external database setup required (uses InMemory database)

## Getting Started

This application uses an InMemory database for simplicity and works across all platforms with no additional setup required.

1. Clone this repository or download a ZIP archive of the repository. For more information, see [How to download a sample](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core#how-to-download-a-sample).

2. Build and run the application:
   ```
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

3. The application uses Entity Framework Core InMemory database provider, so no database setup is required. Sample sci-fi movie data (Mad Max series) will be automatically seeded when the application starts.

4. The default URLs for the application are `https://localhost:7073` (secure HTTPS) and `http://localhost:5261` (insecure HTTP).
   
   You can use the existing URLs or update them in the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file.

5. Navigate to the application in your browser to explore:
   - **Home**: Welcome page
   - **Counter**: Interactive counter demonstration
   - **Weather**: Weather information display
   - **Movies**: Complete movie database management with search, filtering, and CRUD operations

## Movie Data Model

Each movie in the database contains the following information:
- **Title**: Movie name (3-60 characters, required)
- **Release Date**: When the movie was released
- **Genre**: Movie category with validation (letters, spaces, hyphens, parentheses)
- **Price**: Cost information (0-100, currency format)
- **Rating**: MPAA rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Blazor Server with Razor components
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 8.0
- **Database**: Entity Framework Core with InMemory provider
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap for responsive design
- **Data Grid**: QuickGrid component for efficient data display
- **Validation**: Data Annotations for form validation
- **Architecture**: Component-based with dependency injection

## Package roll-forward behavior

The NuGet packages referenced in the project file (`.csproj`) aren't necessarily the latest patch package releases. However, patch releases in .NET roll-forward automatically when the app is built and packages are restored. There's no need to update the package versions in the project file to the latest patch releases.

## Clean up

When you're finished exploring the application, you can simply delete the application folder. Since the application uses an InMemory database, no database cleanup is required - all data is automatically cleared when the application stops.
